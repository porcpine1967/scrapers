Miscellaneous scripts for scraping data

I wrote these scripts to run on cron so I could get urls for comics and podcast without going to the actual webpages hosting them. They started in python2.4, as that was the version that was running on the server I was using.

## Setup

Get a mysql database running. Create a database called 'aliddet7_comics'. Put the credentials for the database in a .my.cnf file at ~.  Run any of the scripts!
